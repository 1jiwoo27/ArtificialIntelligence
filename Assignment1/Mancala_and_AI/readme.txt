# Kalaha Game and AI

## Overview
This directory contains two Python scripts: one for playing the game and another for implementing an AI to play against. 

## Scripts:
1. Kalaha_02180.py: This script provides the implementation of the Kalaha game.
2. AI.py: This script implements an AI player for the Kalaha game.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8

## Usage
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory containing both scripts. Use 
	cd C:Your/directory
4. Run the 'Kalaha_02180.py' script using the following command:
	python Kalaha_02180.py
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game.

## Gameplay Instructions
- The Kalaha board consists of 12 small pockets (6 per player) and 2 larger Mancala pits.
- Players take turns picking up beeds from one of their pockets and distributing them counterclockwise.
- The game ends when one player has no more stones in their pockets.
- The player with the most stones in their Mancala at the end wins.

## AI Implementation
The AI implemented in 'AI.py' uses a MINIMAX algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to make strategic decisions.
